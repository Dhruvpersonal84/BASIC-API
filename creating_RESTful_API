Creating REST API 
so in this case we are developing the small api with respect to post
so in that case the things we will use to create they are:-


GET     /posts      to get the data for all posts
POST    /posts      to post a new information
GET     /posts/:id   to get information of user
PATCH   /posts/:id   to update the post of user 
DELETE  /posts/:id   to delete the post of user
